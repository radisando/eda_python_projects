# 📊 EDA Python Projects

A collection of my **exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects built in Python** using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
This repository serves as a personal playground to practice data cleaning, feature exploration, visualization, and analytical storytelling using real-world datasets.


### 🎯 Goal

My purpose here is to continuously improve my analytical thinking, playing with Python for data-handling and to extract insights from different datasets. 


### 🧪 What’s Inside (so far)

This repo currently includes the following EDA projects:

**1. Titanic Survival Analysis**: Explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns by age, gender, class, and other key features.

**2. Stock Market Analysis**:

*In progress...* 
<!-- I will analyze historical stock price data, exploring price trends, and key indicators over time.-->

**3. Elections Analysis**:

*In progress...*
<!-- Exploring an election-related dataset to understand voting patterns, and demographic insights.-->
