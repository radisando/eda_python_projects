# 📊 EDA Python Projects

A collection of my **exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects built in Python** using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
This repository serves as a personal playground to practice data cleaning, feature exploration, visualization, and analytical storytelling using real-world datasets.


### 🧪 What’s Inside (so far)

This repo currently includes three standalone EDA projects:

**1. Titanic Survival Analysis**:

Explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns by age, gender, class, and other key features.

**2. Stock Market Analysis**:

*In progress...* 

(It will analyze historical stock price data, exploring price trends, and key indicators over time.)

**3. Elections Analysis**:

*In progress...* 

(I will examine election-related datasets to understand voting patterns, and demographic insights.)


### 🎯 Purpose

My goal is to continuously improve my analytical thinking, playing with Python for data-handling and to extract insights from different datasets. 


### ⚙️ Tech Stack
